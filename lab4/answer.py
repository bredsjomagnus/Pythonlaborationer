Dictionaries and tuples

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 1. Dictionaries 
 
Some basics with dictionaries. 
"""

"""
Exercise 1.1 
 
Create a small phonebook using a dictionary. Use the names as keys and
numbers as values. Use 'Chandler, Monica, Ross' and corresponding numbers:
'55523645, 55564452, 55545872'. Add the phonenumbers as integers. Answer
with the resulting dictionary. 

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
"""


ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.
print(dbwebb.assertEqual("1.1", ANSWER, False))

"""
Exercise 1.2 
 
How many items are there in the dictionary?  

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
"""

ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.
print(dbwebb.assertEqual("1.2", ANSWER, False))

"""
Exercise 1.3 
 
Use the 'get()' method on your phonebook and answer with the phonenumber of
'Ross'.  

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
"""

ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.
print(dbwebb.assertEqual("1.3", ANSWER, False))

"""
Exercise 1.4 
 
Get all keys from the dictionary and return them in a sorted list.  

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
"""

ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.
print(dbwebb.assertEqual("1.4", ANSWER, False))

"""
Exercise 1.5 
 
Get all values from the dictionary and return them in a sorted list.  

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
"""


ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.
print(dbwebb.assertEqual("1.5", ANSWER, False))

"""
Exercise 1.6 
 
Use the in-operator to test if the name 'Ross' exists in the dictionary.
Answer with the return boolean value. 

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
"""


ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.
print(dbwebb.assertEqual("1.6", ANSWER, False))

Exercise 1.7 
 
Use the in-operator to test if the phone number 55545872 exists in the
dictionary. Answer with the return boolean value. 

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.

ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.

"""
Exercise 1.8 
 
Use a for-loop to walk through the dictionary and and create a string
representing it. Each name and number should be on its own row, separated
by a space. The names must come in alphabetical order. Answer with the
resulting string. 

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
"""


ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.
print(dbwebb.assertEqual("1.8", ANSWER, False))

"""
Exercise 1.9 
 
Convert the phonenumber to a string and add the prefix '+1-', representing
the language code, to each phone-number. Answer with the resulting
dictionary. 

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
"""


ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# Is the answer as expected?
# When you get stuck - change False to True to get a hint.

Exercise 1.10 
 
Get and remove the item 'Ross' from the phonebook (use pop()). Answer with
the resulting dictionary. 

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.

Exercise 1.11 
 
Add the item you just popped from the phonebook. Answer with the resulting
dictionary. 

Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.

Section 2. Tuples 
 
Some basics with tuples

"""
Exercise 2.1 
 
Create a tuple with 'bear, 65, 6.47, chair, 5'. Answer with the length of
the tuple as an integer.
