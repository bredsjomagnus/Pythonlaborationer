<p>Dictionaries and tuples
</p>


<h2>1. Dictionaries</h2>

<p>Some basics with dictionaries.</p>


<h3>Exercise 1.1</h3>

<p>Create a small phonebook using a dictionary. Use the names as keys and numbers as values. Use 'Chandler, Monica, Ross' and corresponding numbers: '55523645, 55564452, 55545872'. Add the phonenumbers as integers. Answer with the resulting dictionary.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.2</h3>

<p>How many items are there in the dictionary? 
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.3</h3>

<p>Use the 'get()' method on your phonebook and answer with the phonenumber of 'Ross'. 
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.4</h3>

<p>Get all keys from the dictionary and return them in a sorted list. 
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.5</h3>

<p>Get all values from the dictionary and return them in a sorted list. 
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.6</h3>

<p>Use the in-operator to test if the name 'Ross' exists in the dictionary. Answer with the return boolean value.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.7</h3>

<p>Use the in-operator to test if the phone number 55545872 exists in the dictionary. Answer with the return boolean value.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.8</h3>

<p>Use a for-loop to walk through the dictionary and and create a string representing it. Each name and number should be on its own row, separated by a space. The names must come in alphabetical order. Answer with the resulting string.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.9</h3>

<p>Convert the phonenumber to a string and add the prefix '+1-', representing the language code, to each phone-number. Answer with the resulting dictionary.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.10</h3>

<p>Get and remove the item 'Ross' from the phonebook (use pop()). Answer with the resulting dictionary.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.11</h3>

<p>Add the item you just popped from the phonebook. Answer with the resulting dictionary.
</p>







<h2>2. Tuples</h2>

<p>Some basics with tuples</p>


<h3>Exercise 2.1</h3>

<p>Create a tuple with 'bear, 65, 6.47, chair, 5'. Answer with the length of the tuple as an integer.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.2</h3>

<p>Create a tuple out of: (bear, 65, 6.47, chair, 5). Assign each value in the tuple to different variables: 'a','b','c','d','e'. Answer with the variable: 'd'. Hint: a,b,c = tuple.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.3</h3>

<p>Use the list [45, 22, 2, 498, 78]. Assign the first two elements to a tuple with a slice on the list. Answer with the first element in the tuple as an integer.
</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.4</h3>

<p>Create a tuple with (moose, 12, 1.98, table, 7). Convert it to a list and replace the second element with: 'elevator'. Convert it back to a tuple and answer with the first three elements in a comma-separated string.
</p>
